# sprite-collisions
My edits to a monogame tutorial by Ooyou: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV8P9aq2gQo

* added some additional collidable objects to the scene and a 3rd player object
* fixed a bug that prevented collisions in certain situations where there are more than 2 player objects
* added logic to resolve collisions such that the objects are touching exactly instead of leaving a small gap
